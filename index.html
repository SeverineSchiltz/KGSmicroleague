			<h1>Presentation</h1>
			<p>The KGS Micro-League is a league for mid-dan player started on Kiseido Go Server (KGS) on july 2017.</p>
			<p>It works as a study group, with activities and continuous tournament organised througout the year.</p>
			<p>The purpose is to provide a strong training environment to mid-dan players in order to progress quickly.</p>
			<p>Solving problems together, playing against strong opponents and review games together is an excellent way to make progress.</p>
			<p>One things only is needed: your motivation!</p>
			<p></p>
			
			<h1>Rules of the league</h1>
			<p>The main activity is a continuous tournament, with one round per week played on KGS Go Server into the dedicated room (KGS Micro League).</p>
			<p>Games time setting are 40min+5x40, japanese rules, komi=6.5, color determined by Nigiri.</p>
			<p>Special arrangement can be taken with opponent in case of unavaibility. Game should be played within 7 days (exception are allowed from time to time)and results sent to league admin. Otherwise result is a bye (no point) for both.</p>
			<p>One victory bring 1 point and one defeat bring 0,5 point. Player with most points at the end of the season is the league winner. Special final games are organized during last round to prevent egality between players.</p>
			<p>Good behaviour is required. We expect the player to study their game together. From time to time, some games will be reviewed by external teacher.</p>
			<p>Other activities (solving problems, studying pro games) are free to follow. Of course it’s better for you to attend as much as possible activities in order to train well and progress.</p>
			<p>At the end of each cycle the winner of the league will have the opportunity to play a pedagogic game against a strong player (probably an EGF pro).</p>
			<p></p>
			
			<h1>Pedagogic games offered to Winner of the league</h1>
			<p>At the end of each cycle the winner of the league will be granted with a pedagogic game from a top european player.</p>
			<p>The teacher can either be a top european player (Tanguy le Calvé 6d, Christian Pop 7d, Oh Chimin 8d) or a EGF Pro (Pavol Lisy 1p, Alexander Dinnerstein 3p).</p>
